# BBScript - Broscar

A fork of Pangaea's original ( [GitHub - super-continent/bbscript](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript) ), built specifically to cater to my personal workflow.

Not implicitly incompatible with other Arcsys titles, but this fork has not been tested with anything other than DBFZ.

Check out [GitHub - dobosken/dbfz_npp](https://github.com/dobosken/dbfz_npp) for better BBS editing with Notepad++.

## Changes from vanilla BBScript

- Indentation is now done with tabs, and is less likely to break due to vanilla Arcsys errors

- Support for opening and closing braces. Enables somewhat decent code folding, theme styling etc.

- Tweaks to automatically correct vanilla Arcsys errors in JNNEF, BRS and ASN

- A heavily tweaked DBFZ database. Combines datamined information with nice community-given names
